{"name":"Foogle","tagline":"Get instant access to restaurant menus","body":"\r\nHave you ever been in a situation when you are about to walk in a restaurant not sure if you are making the right call? What if that Japanese restaurant does not have ‘Hot lava roll’ that you want to eat? Sure, some restaurants have menus outside but they are not very common. Many have websites or are listed on sites like Yelp. But getting to the actual menu might seem a hassle if you are really hungry or you want to make quick decisions. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just get the menu as a pop-up notification on your smartphone when you are near a restaurant? That is the inspiration behind ‘Foogle’. When you turn on this mobile app, your location will be automatically tracked and our algorith will find if there’s a restaurant near you and give you its menu as pop-up notification. You can click on it to get detailed view or you can just swipe the notification to ignore it.\r\n\r\nFoogle is an android app which uses your present location and searches for restaurants near you. If there is a restaurant, it gives you a pop-up notification of the menu. It provides a seamless transition from hunger to satiation.\r\n\r\nComing to play store soon!!\r\n","google":"UA-69544703-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
